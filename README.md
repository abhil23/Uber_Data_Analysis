This uber dataset contains data about Uber’s ridership between September 2014 and August 2015. This dataset contains **~31 million rows** and columns of origin, destination, pickup date and time, trip distance, and duration.

The combination of trip distance and duration allows for **estimating Uber’s revenue** for each trip in NYC. In another hand, the pickup and drop-off locations were anonymized and grouped as taxi zones instead of geographic coordinates. This is a better attempt to preserve data privacy, but it precludes the positioning of such locations on a map.
